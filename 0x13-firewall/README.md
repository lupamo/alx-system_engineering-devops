# Firewall

ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a front-end tool for managing netfilter, which is the default firewall management tool in Linux systems. ufw is designed to make it easier for users to manage firewall rules without needing to deal with complex syntax.

## Here's a basic overview of how ufw works:

- Simplicity: ufw is designed to be easy to use, especially for users who are not familiar with firewall concepts. It provides a simple command-line interface for managing firewall rules.

- Default Deny: By default, ufw denies all incoming connections and allows all outgoing connections. This means that if you enable ufw without adding any rules, all incoming traffic will be blocked.

- Rules: You can add rules to ufw to allow or deny specific types of traffic. Rules can be based on port numbers, IP addresses, or protocols. For example, you can create a rule to allow incoming SSH traffic on port 22.

- Profiles: ufw supports different profiles, such as default, logging, and openSSH. Profiles allow you to easily switch between different sets of rules based on your needs.

- Logging: ufw can log blocked connections, which can be useful for troubleshooting or monitoring network activity. Logging can be enabled or disabled using ufw.

- Application Integration: ufw integrates with some applications to automatically configure firewall rules. For example, if you install a web server, ufw can automatically create rules to allow incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

- Status and Management: You can check the status of ufw to see which rules are currently applied. You can also disable or enable ufw as needed.
