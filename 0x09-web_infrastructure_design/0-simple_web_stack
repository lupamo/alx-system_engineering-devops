specifics about this infrastructure
-------------------------------------

- What is a server: A server is a computer that sends and recives data from a user client through the internet
- What is the role of the domain name: A domain name is a unique human readable string used to access a website
- What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com: From the infrastructure I've drawn the DNS record is an A type since it maps the domain name directly to the ip address.
- What is the role of the web server: The role of web server is to serve static content to the user client
- What is the role of the application server: Is a program that runs application files, it provides security, scalability, management of resources and easy deployment.
- What is the role of the database: a data base is a software that allows website manage, retrieve, update or change files, information logs and other forms of digital data.
- What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website: using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

The issues are with this infrastructure:
----------------------------------------

A single Point of Failure (SPOF) is a part of a system: Since we have one server if our server goes down or one of it's function files our whole website will go down.
Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted): if  we want to add more code our website will go down since we are using one server.
Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: No loadBalancer and a single server means too much traffic will lead to poor perfomance of our website
